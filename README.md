I'm a Graphic Designer / Web Developer that not only loves to draw but also to be creative by having great ideas for developing meticulous projects with up to date softwares & code languages.

In addition I have insatiable thirst for knowledge. When problem solving I learn more from mistakes. Always up for new challanges that will help me improve my creativity and acquire new computer skills.
